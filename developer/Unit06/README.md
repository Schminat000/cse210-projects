# Poisoned Artifacts
Poisoned Artifacts is a game in which the player seeks to avoid as many artifacts as
possible. The game is timed and will let you know when you are hit by an artifact.
The game is over after a certain time! Try to play the game without getting a
"GAME OVER" spammed in your console!

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have dotnet 6.0 or newer installed on your machine. Open 
a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program 
by running the following commands:
```
dotnet build
dotnet run 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 
Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select "Run and Debug" on 
the Activity Bar. Next, select the project you'd like to run from the 
drop down list at the top of the Side Bar. Lastly, click the green 
arrow or "start debugging" button.

## Project Structure
